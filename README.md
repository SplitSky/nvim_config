# Split nvim config

## External dependencies note
External Requirements:
- Basic utils: `git`, `make`, `unzip`, C Compiler (`gcc`)
- [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep#installation)
- Clipboard tool (xclip/xsel/win32yank or other depending on platform)
- A [Nerd Font](https://www.nerdfonts.com/): optional, provides various icons
  - if you have it set `vim.g.have_nerd_font` in `init.lua` to true
- Language Setup:
  - If you want to write Typescript, you need `npm`
  - If you want to write Golang, you will need `go`
  - etc.

### This config is based on kickstart -> see kickstart.nvim for majority of it

This is my config. I have spent about 15min cleaning this up and I have like 3 versions of it floating across different machines. If you steal it don't expect it to work.
I may clean it some day but this day isn't today
